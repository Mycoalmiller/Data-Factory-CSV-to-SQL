Hello, 

The ARM template is used to build out the SQL Database, SQL server, Container and Resource Group in Azure. 

The Pipelines file is used to connect a Blob Storage account to an SQL database. Linked services, Datasets and Copy Activity are included. 

The Cars file is the CSV file that we'll be using for the sample data.
